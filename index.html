		 <h1>Here's a  timeline of John Garang's life</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1945:</strong> John Garang was born on June 23rd in Buk, Sudan (now South Sudan). He belonged to the Dinka ethnic group.</li>
    <li><strong>1962:</strong> Garang joined the Sudanese army, starting his military career. He attended the Sudan Military College in Wadi Sayedna and pursued further military education in the United States, Egypt, and Tanzania.</li>

    <li><strong>1972:</strong> The Addis Ababa Agreement was signed, ending the First Sudanese Civil War. Garang returned to Sudan and joined the Sudanese army as an officer.</li>
    <li><strong>1983:</strong> Garang resigned from the Sudanese army and founded the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A).
